# Supreme Leader of Robots

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an embedded programmer with a big interest in robotics, a Rust enthusiast, and a civil engineering student at Boğaziçi University. When I'm not coding, I enjoy diving into some complex compositions—you might say it's the kind of music that doesn't mind if you chew gum while thinking.  I’m also one of the co-founders of [NFR Products](https://nfrproducts.com), where we’re working on all sorts of cool projects in the robotics space. I’ve been involved in FRC since 2019, so robotics has a big place in my life.

### Current Projects

- **elevator\_optimization**: This is a Rust-based framework I’m building to test the efficiency of elevator algorithms. It’s more than just algorithms; it includes a neural network (trained with a genetic algorithm!) to explore and improve elevator performance. It’s exciting to see how different algorithms measure up under simulated conditions.

- **alpay\_ftc**: An AI-driven project aimed at robotics competitions, where I’m developing an AI driver to replace human drivers. This uses Docker, ROS2, Go, and AI, and it’s not just about the driving—it also lets us simulate FTC robots in ROS. I’m using this environment to test potential NFR Products software releases, so it’s a major step toward our future product line.

### Some Past Projects

*Most of these were personal experiments, so they're a bit hard to read – README files were a luxury back then. I never expected anyone else to look at them :-(*

- **vector-h**: My first pure C project from four years ago. It’s a C99 macro that lets you create vector classes for any type, so you get some flexibility even in C. This was one of my first experiences diving deep into low-level programming, and it laid the groundwork for some of my later work in Rust.

- **utility\_muffin\_research\_kitchen**: This project is dedicated to exploring various innovative ideas, but always remember, the white zone is for loading and unloading only.

- **DBEX**: Written in Python about five years ago, this parser uses generators to process large JSON files one object at a time. The main goal here was efficient memory usage, so instead of loading an entire JSON file, it parses each object individually, which is perfect for large datasets. I designed it specifically to handle AI data files without maxing out RAM, and it taught me a lot about memory management in Python.

- **megaboi**: An Arduino-based “phone” from five years ago. I designed it to function like a basic device with a screen, buttons, and an internet card—all on an Arduino Mega. This project started as a fun way to make games, but it quickly became an exercise in optimization when I hit the 4KB RAM limit on the Mega. This experience ignited my obsession with efficient code and hardware optimization, which still influences my work today. It made me realize the beauty of working within constraints, and how pushing the limits can lead to some of the most creative solutions.

- **Just for Fun**: Over the years, I’ve created some smaller algorithms and experiments just for fun. This includes things like pathfinding and line of sight algorithms, plus an unfinished robot simulation (aptly named “Second Robotics Competition”). These were mostly quick experiments to explore new ideas or test out concepts, but they were great practice for my current projects.

I have many more projects, but most are private for now.
